# OO Design

## SOLID

The first 5 principles of OOP:

S - Single-responsibility Principle  ***A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.***

O - Open-closed Principle ***Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.***

L - Liskov Substitution Principle ***Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.***

I - Interface Segregation Principle ***A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.***

D - Dependency Inversion Principle ***Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.***
