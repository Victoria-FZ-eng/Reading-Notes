# Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.


**Vertex** - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
**Edge** - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
**Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
**Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

**We represent graphs through:**

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List


* Traversals  => Depth First - Breadth First
