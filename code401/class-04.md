# OOP Object-Oriented Programming

1. Every object has *state* stored in fields and *behavior* as method.
2. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
3. Data encapsulation : hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
4. Classes consist of fields, methods and constructors.


5. Numbers:
  * Decimals ex.54.985
  * Bases (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)
  * Binary Numbers
  * Hexadecimal Numbers
