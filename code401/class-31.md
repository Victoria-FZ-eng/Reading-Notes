# Espresso

The Espresso is a testing(automated testing) API

The core API is small, predictable, and easy to learn and yet remains open for customization. Espresso tests state expectations, interactions, and assertions clearly without the distraction of boilerplate content, custom infrastructure, or messy implementation details getting in the way.

Espresso provides the ability to test an app without writing any test code. **How is that?.** By recording a test scenario...

1. record your interactions with a device and add assertions to verify UI elements in particular snapshots of your app. 
2. Espresso Test Recorder then takes the saved recording and automatically generates a corresponding UI test that you can run to test your app.
