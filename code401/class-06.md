#  Interfaces and Inheritance

## Inheritance 

Subclass can inherit fields and methods from a superclass.
A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

## Interfaces

Like a class that only contains constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces. 
To declare a class that implements an interface, you include an implements clause in the class declaration.
