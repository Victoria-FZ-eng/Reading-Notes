# HTML Images

This is how you add an image `<img` + `src="here you paste the copied link or relative path" alt = "here you ente an alternative name of the image"` + `/>`. you add some styling also like the dimensions and the alignment, you should pay attention  to the images formate and resolusion / you can use online tools to edit them. check the references below for more information.

## Which img format to use 

Use *JPEG* format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. 

Use *PNG* format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. 

Use *GIF* format for images that contain animations.

*Choosing the correct format and compression is a major factor that determines image size.* (this is quoted from the article)
