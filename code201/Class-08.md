# CSS Layout

This was [previously explained](../Class-04.md), but here are some useful notes:

## Positioning Elements

As we said before CSS treats every element as it's in a box, there are many attributes for positioning and each has it's own properties.
`position:static` ,`position:relative` ,`position:absolute` ,`position:fixed`, so using them depending on how you would like display your page.

`z-index` attribute is used when overlapping; to control what element is on the top of the other element by setting a number for this attribute , the higher the number the closer the element to the front.

`float` is used to float the elements and if you want you can put them beside each other(make multi columns) and you can also do this using `clear` attribute. 

## Screen Sizes and layouts

* Each device has it's own size so you can adjust you page size to vary depending on the users device.
* There are also the fixed sized (Fixed width layout) this is more accurate for the sizes of the elements .
* Liquid Layouts :stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
* You can use Grids to simplify the designing .
