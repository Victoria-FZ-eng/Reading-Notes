So, as a summary of what I've been reading...

The first Topic talked about text editors that they are all the same , the best text editor is the one you enjoy working on. And it explained some examples of text editors (eg. NotePad++ , VSCode, ....) and some features (eg. emmet , extensions,....)
The second topic talked about the command line (terminal) that it is a text based interface to the system , and talked about the shell.
the third topic talked about the navigation ( what we discussed during our zoom meeting about the pwd , ls , cd, cd..  and the paths.
The last topic explained the files and their extensions  , and explained that on linux  spaces and the case of the letters matter so we have to pay attention to them.
