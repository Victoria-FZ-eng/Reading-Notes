This explain the way of styling texts using markdown on github ,
by using different symbols and paying attention to (spaces) and lines .

eg. you can bold the words by adding (**) or (__) before and after the words.
eg2. you can make the headers by using the symbol (#) before the header; from 1-6 the more the number the smaller the header.
eg.3 using (~~) before and after the sentence will cross the whole sentence .
