Well,

Chapter 18 talks about creating websites and the best procedure to do this ; like First o fall you need to understand the audience you're tracking , and then de a site map and plan the site by doing a wireframe. You should pay attention to the design to effectively communicate the services of the company. You should also create visual hierarchy  to help users find what they are looking for by choosing the right size, color, style & contrast. Also Organizing visual elements into groups. 
And finally I would mention for your site to be concise, clear, selective, provides context, interactive and consistent.

And for chapter 17, it talks about the traditional and the new version of HTML elements. For eg. <div> is used in traditional HTML to group related elements, another examples for the latest version HTML5 , eg.  <header> , <article> , <nav> , <figure> , ...  and what they are used for.

And finally for chapter 8, it talks about the versions of HTML and explains some escape characters ,which I find an interesting information, here are some examples : for the sign (&) you can type: either "&amp;" or "&#38;" ,for the trade mark sign you can type : either "&trade;" or "$#8482;" .
