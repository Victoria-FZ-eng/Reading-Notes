# Functional Programming

### Functional programming 

Is a programming paradigm *a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs* that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .

### Pure functions

* Does not use global obj unless it was passed as a parameter.
* Does not read external files.
* Does not rely on a random number generator `Math.random()` .
* Does not cause any observable side effects.

**Why pure functions** -> Code is easier to test.

**Immutability** ->  When data is immutable, its state *cannot change* after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

**Referential transparency** -> Always have the same output, given the same input. *pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency* .


# Modules and require();

**Module** is a js file with a certain functionality in the application, called whenever needed by assigning **require('module's path')** to a variable(calling using the variable) and must be available to use *by exporting the module **module.exports*** .
