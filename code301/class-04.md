# React and Forms


## Forms

1. React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input (Value is controlled).
2. To target what the user enters , we set a `<value>` attribute .


## Conditional Operator

example :
```
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }
```

rewriting this code using conditional operator `(x === y) ? >= 'true' : 'false'; `
