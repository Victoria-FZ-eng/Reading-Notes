# NODE.JS

## What ?

An event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime *(program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers)* that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine *(open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Chromium-based web browsers)* and libuv library.(back end technology).

npm -> Node Package Manager.

Type the command `node -v` to get what node version you have installed *(v12.21.0 is the version i'm using)*.

Type the command `npm -v` to get what version of npm you have installed *(6.14.11 is the version i'm using)*.

Type the command `jshint index.js` to install the ‘jshint’ library/package.

## Why?

1. Installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

2. Scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. 

3. Writing your own command line tool.

4. Building cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
