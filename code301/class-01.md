# Introduction to React and Components 

## What, Why & How

A component is a code (function, object, event, property) that is **reusable** and interact with other components to conform a behaviour . Several components with a specific dataflow represents well defined communication interfaces.
Components are *Reusable*, *Replacable*, *Not Contex Specific*, *Extensible*, *Encapsulated* & *Independent*. 

Why to use component based architecture ?

1. Because of the cost and time reduction.
2. Ease of deployment and development.
3. Modification of technical complexity.
4. System maintenance and evolution

## Props in React

Props (properities) is the one-way-direction of passing read-only data between components (parent to child).
